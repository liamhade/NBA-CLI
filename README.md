## Setbacks
I could have just used the NBA API, but one of the reasons I wanted to do this 
project was to get more familiar with Selenium. 

This project is proving especially challenging because of how NBA.com is loaded. It uses alot of dynamic HTML elements using React, which make calling `driver.page_source` ineffective.

Going to come back later, then try one more time to get selenium working.
If that doesn't work, I'm just going to use swar's NBA API from
'https://github.com/swar/nba_api'

For the sake of completing this project, I'm just going to use the
API I listed above.
